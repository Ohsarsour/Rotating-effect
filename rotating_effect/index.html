        <h1>Whatever happened to stud Saints Wr Michael Thomas?</h1>
        <small>Obaidullah Sarsour</small>
        <p>
          Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas has been absent pretty much all of
          the 2021 season due to an ankle injury he suffered in the offseason.
          Thomas started his NFL career with four consecutive 1,000 plus
          receiving yard seasons. He also broke the NFL record for most catches
          in a season with 149 back in 2019. He was named NFL Offensive Player
          of the Year in 2019. Then, in his fifth season in 2020, injuries
          caused him to only play in seven games. And this season? Thomas has
          recorded zero completions or attempts this season.
        </p>

          The New Orleans Saints are hoping to add a Healthy Michael Thomas to a
          roster that went 9-8 without their star QB and Star WR along with
          covid issues that haunted the team
